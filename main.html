			<h2>About:</h2>	
			<p>Welcome to my page. This is my first attempt in the world of coding.</p>
			<p>I joined the StarterLeauge to build a fundamental base of technical knowledge off which to grow from and to open up the opportunity to pursue some of my personal ideas.</P>
			<p>A founder of a successful start-up gave me a key piece of advice, which was "fail early - fail often", so here goes nothing! Be sure to check-out my Blog posts to follow my progress in and outside of class during the quarter.</p>

			<h3>Marc at a glance......</p>
			<h2>Experience:</h2>
			<p>I work with start-up technology and clean-tech companies at Silicon Valley Bank. I'm fortunate to being able to go into work every day and work with passionate and skilled entrepenurs.</p>
			<p>Prior to joining SVB, I worked in the securities industry conducting audits and investigations of financial firms.</p> 

			<h2>Education:</H2>
			<P>I graduated from the University of Iowa in 2007 with a degree in Finance and minor in Entrepenurship. Oh yea I also earned the right to use the CFA Designation after passing all three levels on the first attempt.</P>

			<h2>Community:</h2>			
			<p>For the past year and a half I have been a child life volunteer at Ann and Robert Lurie Children's Hospital (formerly Children's Memorial) doing bedside visits with 3-12 year olds on inpatient floors.</p>
			<p>I will be running my first marathon on the hospital's team at the Chicago Bank of America Marathon in October 2013. Click on the link below to donate to my fundraising efforts.</P>
