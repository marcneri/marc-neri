		<h2>Week 0 - Background:</h2>
		<p>So every-year on the date of the Chicago Marathon I would wake-up around 9:00-10:00am in the morning and go watch the runners outside of my apartment (Fulton Market --> Old Town --> Lincoln Park) and would say next year is the year, but then reality would set back in a few days later and I would remember that I did not like running. So for the past few years that would be the end of it. </p>
